        hosting: {
          question: "What are hosting, domain, and email setup?",
          answer: "Think of hosting as your digital shop space on the internet, domain as your online address (like www.yourbusiness.com), and professional email as your business mailbox (like contact@yourbusiness.com). We handle all the technical setup, so you don't have to worry about anything!"
        },
        googleBusiness: {
          question: "What are Google Business and Search Console?",
          answer: "These are tools that help a website appear higher on Google and attract free visitors. Google Business Profile allows customers to find the business on Google Maps and search results, with details like opening hours, photos, and reviews. Search Console takes care of indexing the website so it appears in Google searches, and provides checks and optimizations for better visibility."
        },        
        eshopPlatforms: {
          question: "WordPress or Shopify - which should I choose?",
          answer: "Both are excellent choices! WordPress gives you more flexibility and lower monthly costs but requires more maintenance. Shopify is simpler to use and includes hosting but has higher monthly fees. We'll help you choose the best option based on your needs and budget."
        },
        customization: {
          question: "How do you customize my website to match my brand?",
          answer: "We tailor everything to your brand identity — from colors and fonts to layouts and features. We can create custom product displays, unique checkout experiences, and add any specific functionality your business needs."
        },
        hiddenFees: {
          question: "Are there any hidden fees?",
          answer: "No hidden fees! We believe in complete transparency. All costs are clearly outlined upfront in our packages. The only additional costs would be for custom requirements beyond the package scope, which we'll discuss and agree upon before proceeding with any work."
        },
        timeToLaunch: {
          question: "How long does it take to launch my website?",
          answer: "Basic websites usually launch within 2–3 weeks, while e-commerce stores take around 3–4 weeks. Custom projects' timelines vary based on complexity. We'll provide you with a detailed timeline during our initial consultation. Throughout the process, you'll have access to a development preview to watch your site come to life!"
